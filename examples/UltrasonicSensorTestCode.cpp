//! \brief Interface for sensors
//!
//! One of the interfaces that need to be defined early on are the interfaces  
//! for the various types of sensors. One of the aspirations of 
//! R2D2 is modularity and for that we need to define the interface for sensors
//! like DistanceSensors, PositionSensors and SpeedSensors.

//! \brief  Test code for sensor interfaces (mainly Ultrasonic Sensor)
//!
//! This code will test the Ultrasonic Sensor and show how to use the sensor. 
//! It will just keep reading the distance from the Ultrasonic Sensor as long as
//! the program is running.
