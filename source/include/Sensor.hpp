//! \brief Interface for sensors
//!
//! One of the interfaces that need to be defined early on are the interfaces  
//! for the various types of sensors. One of the aspirations of 
//! R2D2 is modularity and for that we need to define the interface for sensors
//! like DistanceSensors, PositionSensors and SpeedSensors.

//! \brief  Interface for sensors: base class of all sensors
//!
//! This is the base class for all sensors. To use this class you should define 
//! the template used by this Sensor. This template class will then be returned
//! by the get_data() method which should be overridden.
