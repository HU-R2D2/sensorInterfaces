//! \brief Interface for sensors
//!
//! One of the interfaces that need to be defined early on are the interfaces  
//! for the various types of sensors. One of the aspirations of 
//! R2D2 is modularity and for that we need to define the interface for sensors
//! like DistanceSensors, PositionSensors and SpeedSensors.

//! \brief  Interface for class that combines a Coordinate and an Attitude
//!
//! This class was written to combine a Coordinate and an Attitude. This 
//! class should actually be under ADTs, but at the time of writing there
//! was no time to do so.
